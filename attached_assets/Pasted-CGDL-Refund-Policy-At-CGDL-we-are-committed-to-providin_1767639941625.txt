CGDL Refund Policy
At CGDL, we are committed to providing an exceptional experience for our participants at our events. We also recognize that circumstances may arise where participants seek clarification about refunds. This document outlines the terms and conditions regarding refunds for registrations made through our platform.

General Policy
Mandatory and Non-Refundable Registration Fee: The registration fee for scholarship categories is mandatory, non-refundable, and cannot be disputed under any circumstances.
Agreement to Terms and Conditions: Before completing the checkout process for fully and partially funded applications, all applicants are required to review and sign the declaration of terms and conditions. This step is mandatory and ensures transparency.
Refund Eligibility
Refunds will only be issued in the form of credit vouchers under specific conditions, as outlined below. These credit vouchers can be used for future CGDL events.

Fully Funded and Partially Funded Applicants
The registration fee for these categories is strictly non-refundable and non-transferable.
Self-Funded Applicants
Participation in self-funded and forum admission categories is nontransferable.
Delegates who pay the full registration fee for the self-funded and forum admission category are eligible for refunds in the form of CGDL Credit Voucher (CVV) under certain conditions.
In case of a refund, the registration fee for the invitation letter along with tax will be deducted from the Forum Admission and Self-Funded package. The remaining amount will be issued as a CGDL Credit Voucher (CVV) in accordance with our terms and conditions.
Conditions for CGDL Credit Vouchers
The full conference fee must be paid in a single transaction (not in installments).
Requests for credit vouchers must be submitted via email at least 45 days prior to the first day of the event.
Delegates submitting requests 30 days prior will be charged a 50% cancellation fee, with the remaining amount issued as a CCV.
Delegates submitting requests 15 days prior will be charged a 75% cancellation fee, with the remaining amount issued as a CCV.
Requests made less than 15 days prior to the event will result in 100% retention of the paid amount as a cancellation fee, and no CCV will be issued.
CGDL Credit Voucher Terms and Conditions
Validity: CCVs are valid for 12 months from the date of issuance.
Non-Transferable: CCVs are non-transferable, can be redeemed only once, and can only be used by the original recipient.
No Cash Value: CCVs cannot be redeemed for cash.
Partial Redemption: If the CCV value exceeds the registration fee for a future event, the remaining balance will be carried forward for future use.
Usage Limitation: CCVs can only be applied to CGDL-organized events.
Special Circumstances
Force Majeure: In the event of unforeseen circumstances such as natural disasters, political instability, or other emergencies, CGDL reserves the right to evaluate refund requests on a case-by-case basis.
