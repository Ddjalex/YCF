Based on the styling of the website and the image you provided, the "Apply Now" button uses a Diagonal Slide-In (or "Sweep to Right") hover effect.

This specific style uses a hidden background layer that is slanted at an angle and slides across the button when you hover over it.

CSS Code for Replit
To apply this smooth, slanted animation to your buttons in Replit, you can use the following CSS. This uses the ::before pseudo-element to create the sliding color block.

CSS

/* Apply this to your button class (e.g., .apply-btn) */
.btn {
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden; /* Important: keeps the slant inside the button */
  padding: 15px 35px;
  background-color: #222; /* Initial dark background */
  color: #fff;
  border: none;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  cursor: pointer;
  z-index: 1;
  transition: color 0.4s ease;
}

/* The sliding diagonal background */
.btn::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: -110%; /* Starts completely hidden on the left */
  width: 120%;  /* Extra width for the slant */
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #ff9d00; /* The yellow/orange color from the site */
  transform: skewX(-30deg);  /* Creates the diagonal angle */
  transition: left 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1); /* Makes it smooth */
  z-index: -1; /* Keeps the color behind the button text */
}

/* Hover effect: Slide the color into view */
.btn:hover::before {
  left: -10%; 
}

/* Change text color on hover if needed */
.btn:hover {
  color: #000;
}
Why this style works for the YDF 2026 site:
Angle: The transform: skewX(-30deg) gives it a dynamic, forward-moving look that matches the "youth development" theme.

Smoothing: The cubic-bezier transition makes the movement feel "snappy"—it starts fast and slows down right as it fills the button, which feels more professional than a simple linear slide.

Contrast: Using a bright accent color (like the yellow seen on the site) against a dark background makes the "Apply Now" action stand out immediately to users.
