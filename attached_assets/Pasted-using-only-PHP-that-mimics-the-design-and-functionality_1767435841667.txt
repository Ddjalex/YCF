using only PHP that mimics the design and functionality of the UNPSF 2025 website, you need a description that emphasizes a clean, professional, and institutional aesthetic.

The UNPSF 2025 site is characterized by a "Corporate/International Organization" style: high-contrast blue and white color palettes, hero sections with countdown timers, clear navigation grids for "News" and "Agenda," and mobile-responsive layouts.

The Project Description
"A professional, institutional-grade event management platform inspired by the UNPSF 2025 design. This project is built using a pure PHP procedural model, focusing on a clean, high-performance architecture without heavy frameworks. It features a hero section with a dynamic countdown timer, a responsive grid for 'Latest News' updates, a modular 'Agenda' timeline, and an integrated registration system. The UI follows a professional blue-and-white color scheme, utilizing semantic HTML5 and custom CSS to replicate the authoritative and accessible feel of official United Nations digital portals."

Key Technical Breakdown for Replit (PHP Model)
To match the look of that specific website while sticking to a PHP model, you should structure your Replit project as follows:

1. Structural Logic (The "PHP Model")
Instead of a complex framework, use a Modular Procedural approach. This makes it easy to manage in Replit:

index.php: The main landing page.

header.php / footer.php: Global components to keep the design consistent across all pages (About, Agenda, News).

functions.php: To handle the countdown logic and data fetching for news items.

2. UI/UX Elements to Replicate
Hero Section: A large background image (Samarkand/Institutional theme) with an overlaying "Days/Hours/Minutes" countdown.

Navigation: A sticky top-bar with a simple logo on the left and a "Register" button highlighted in a primary action color (often blue or green).

Data Grids: PHP foreach loops to display news cards from an array or a simple SQLite database.

Typography: Use clean sans-serif fonts like Inter or Roboto to maintain the professional look.
